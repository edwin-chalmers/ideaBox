# IdeaBox

### Abstract:
(Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We built a website that allows the user to jot down ideas with a title and a body of text that is able to to be saved to a local storage. These ideas can then be either deleted or favorited and can be viewed through either the saved or favorites buttons. 


### Installation Instructions:
(What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

The user needs to fork the repository and clone to their local machine. Open in word editor of their choice and launch website from there. 

### Preview of App:
 (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

./assets/max-char-limit-red - The input fields turn red when you reach the max char limit.


### Context:
(Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

Mod 1/Week 4 - This project took about 20 hours to reach MVP

### Learning Goals:
(What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals of this project is to build a functional website from the ground up. This means having a working understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This also meant understanding how to manipulate the Data Model and produce results when elements were used and or targeted. 


### Wins + Challenges:
(What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

One challenge that we had was, getting the hide card features to hide cards. It took us looking into the DEV Tools to see that the default is favorite state was undefined, addressing this issue solved the problem and fixed the bug. Another challenge we had was with the orange star. When we clicked the origial white star the orange star wouldn't take it's place and was positioned oddly. The hidden CSS wasn't replacing the star thus having both elements flexing within the card. This was solved by changing the function to replace the src image.
